In this project, I have used the student performance dataset containing the details of students' performance. 

You can download the dataset from here -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams . 

It consists of details of 1000 students, such as -> gender, parents' education, race/ethnicity, math scores, reading and writing scores, etc. 

I have performed statistical analysis on this data to identify underlying patterns and derive insights using measures of central tendency (mean) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation). Further, I have performed hypothesis testing on the dataset.
