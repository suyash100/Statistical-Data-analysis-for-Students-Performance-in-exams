# Statistical-Data-analysis-for-Students-Performance-in-exams
In this project, I have used the student performance dataset containing the details of students' performance. 
You can download the dataset from here. 
It consists of details of 1000 students, such as gender, parents' education, race/ethnicity, math scores, reading and writing scores, etc. 
I have performed statistical analysis on this data to identify underlying patterns and derive insights using measures of central tendency (mean) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation).
Further, I have performed hypothesis testing on the dataset.
